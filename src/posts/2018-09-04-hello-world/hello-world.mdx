## What?

These posts here will be focused on learning modern JavaScript and web development. It’s a place to document and talk about what I’m currently learning and working on. The problems I’m currently facing. My thoughts on the self-learning process. My own journey and the philosophy behind my self-curated “DIY” coding bootcamp. Successes, and, especially, failures.

## Why?

I’m a self-taught developer. I starting learning to code at the age of 29, on a considerable leap of faith, with no previous background in tech. Perhaps sharing my journey and process can provide some value to someone else.

Maybe it’s someone who has convinced themselves that coding just isn’t for them. Because that was me for my first 29 years of life. Maybe it’s someone who has no talent for math. Me.
Maybe they are dyslexic. Probably me. Or whatever other self-imposed hurdle it is that we often give ourselves.

I don’t talk about my current journey often, or in much detail out in the real world. But when I do, I typical situation seems to play out. I tell someone that I’ve been teaching myself to code, and I’m in the process of changing careers from education from software development. The response I often get is “I wish I could do that”.

When I tell someone that “you can”, I get a smile or nod back, but I can see, or maybe just imagine, that they don’t really buy into that idea. Perhaps I’m projecting too much, because that was definitely me. And thanks to impostor syndrome, on some days it still is me.

But I’ll say it here. And hopefully show it too. _You_ can, because _I_ can.

Anyways, let’s get back to it.

Happy Hacking!
