intro: When to use direct writes, and when to use client-side resolvers.

There are two ways to perform local state management in Apollo Client. Direct writes to the cache, and writing local client side resolvers.

### Direct Writes to the Cache

According to the docs, direct writes are for 1 off mutations that don't depend on data that is alread in the cache. And example of this would be writing an arbitrary string to the cache.

The downside of this is that...

```.js
console.log('im some code')

```

### Client Side Resolvers

Client side resolvers are called via react-apollo mutation components, just like server-side mutations. However, instead of calling a resolver on a GraphQL server, the @client directive directs the call to the client-side resolver map.

Client side resolvers are written just like server side resolvers.
