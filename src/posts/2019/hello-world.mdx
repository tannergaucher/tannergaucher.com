## What?

The posts here will be focused on learning modern JavaScript and web development. The intention is to document what I’m currently learning and working on, talk about problems I’m currently facing, my thoughts on the self-learning process, my journey and the philosophy behind my self-curated “DIY” coding bootcamp, and successes and failures in my current projects.

## Why?

I’m a self-taught developer. I starting learning to code at the age of 29, on a considerable leap of faith, with no previous background in tech. Perhaps sharing my journey and process can provide some value to someone else.

I don’t talk about my current path often, or in much detail, out in the real world. But when I do, A typical situation seems to play out. I tell someone that I’ve been teaching myself to code, and I’m in the process of changing careers from education from software development. The response I often get is along the lines of “I wish I could do that”.

At that point, my reply is “you can”. I get a smile or nod back, but it often feels that they don’t really buy into that idea. Of course not everyone wants to code, too.

But I’ll say it here. And hopefully show it too. _You_ can, because _I_ can.

Anyways, let’s get back to it.
